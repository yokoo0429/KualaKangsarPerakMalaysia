                     <h3>
                        Because of its close relationship to the Perak royal family, Kuala Kangsar is frequently referred to as the Royal Town of Perak. The Ubudiah Mosque, a magnificent example of Moorish and Victorian architecture, and the royal residence, Istana Iskandariah, are located there. In addition to their historical significance, these sites are magnificent representations of Islamic art and architecture.</h3>

                            Built between 1913 and 1917, the mosque was designed by Arthur Benison Hubback, an English architect who was also responsible for the design of Ipoh Railway Station, also known as Taj Mahal Ipoh. As a result of this collaboration, Masjid Ubudiah has been designated a National Heritage under the National Heritage Act 2005.

                            Istana Kenangan was previously known as Istana Kuning, Istana Lembah and Istana Tepas. But only after 1960, it was turned into heritage building by Malaysianâ€™s first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman and renamed as Istana Kenangan. Throughout history, the site has served as a temporary palace resided by Sultan Iskandar Shah while waiting for the completion of the current royal palace, Istana Iskandariah. In 1988, Istana Kenangan opened as Perak Royal Museum.
